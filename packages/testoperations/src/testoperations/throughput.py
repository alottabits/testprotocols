"""Concurrent iperf3 throughput measurement over typed iperf capabilities.

Framing owned here (the reason this is a ``testoperations`` function and not a
step one-liner): start every receiver FIRST (one iperf3 server instance per
flow, each on its own port), snapshot each receiver log's completed-session
count, launch all senders together so the flows genuinely overlap, then poll
each receiver log until a NEW completed session appears and report its
measured rate. The RECEIVE side is read deliberately: the receiver sits behind
the device under test, so its rate is what actually crossed that device
(send-side rates include bytes a shaper may still be queueing or dropping).

Assertion-free and stdlib-only: returns facts (per-flow Mbit/s) and raises only
on operational failures (duplicate ports, a receiver that never produces a
completed session). Pass/fail thresholds belong to the caller.
